This project focuses on predicting public transport fares using machine learning. The aim is to create a reliable and efficient model to assist in dynamic fare pricing by leveraging various influential factors.
The dataset includes variables such as type of vehicle, destination, wind speed, distance traveled, humidity, temperature, 
and cloud cover, which are critical in determining fare fluctuations. We utilized the GradientBoostingRegressor model, 
a robust machine learning algorithm known for its accuracy and efficiency in regression tasks. This model captures complex relationships between the features and the target variable, providing precise fare predictions. 
The project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in solving real-world transportation challenges and offers a foundation for further enhancements, such as incorporating additional features or real-time data.
